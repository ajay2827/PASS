This is a place to distribute templates of the `.env` file for devs to copy. DO NOT put sensitive environment data (e.g. private keys) in any of these templates. Any fields that take sensitive data should be left blank, and devs should fill the fields in manually with their own information. If you need to distribute private keys to devs, find a different way.
